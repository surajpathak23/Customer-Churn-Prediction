- `Modelling.csv` – Dataset with customer features and churn labels

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling Missing Values
- Encoding Categorical Variables
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
- Train-Test Split
- Model Building (Logistic Regression)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🎯 Objective
To help businesses identify customers at high risk of churn so they can proactively address customer concerns and improve satisfaction.
