# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on behavioral and demographic data. Early identification helps businesses take action and improve customer retention strategies.

## 📂 Files Included
- `customer_churn_prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with the complete implementation
- `customer_churn_data.csv` – Dataset with customer features and churn labels
- `final_predictions.csv` – Output file containing final churn predictions after model execution

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling Missing Values
- Encoding Categorical Variables
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
- Train-Test Split
- Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
- Exporting final predictions to `final_predictions.csv`

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🎯 Objective
To help businesses identify customers at high risk of churn so they can proactively address customer concerns and improve satisfaction.

## 📈 Business Value
- Improves customer retention
- Reduces revenue loss from churn
- Supports data-driven decision making in marketing and customer success teams
